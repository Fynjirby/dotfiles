# dotfiles
sorry if they are kinda ugly or not super pro's but i use it and like it
### you are in ~/ directory now, look into
- [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim/) config in .vimrc
- [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/) config in .zshrc
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/) config in .tmux.conf
- [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship/) config in .config/starship.toml
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/) config in .config/alacritty.toml
- [zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/) config in .config/zed/settings.json

NOTE: You need to install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to enable plugins 
<br>
NOTE: tmux colors looks better in alacritty! 

All software listed here is open source btw :)

### do it faster with this command in terminal
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fynjirby/dotfiles/main/install.sh | sh
```
